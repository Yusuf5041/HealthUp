The solution is very large in size so it is hosted on GitHub at:

1) Download the repository
2) Unzip the folder/repository
3) Open the README file 

The solution is contained in two folders:

Build:

	This contains the executable file. Open the application file called 'experimentation'. 
	This requires the use of Unity in order to run so ensure Unity is installed on your computer: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download 

	1) Ensure Unity is installed
	2) Run the executable 'experimentation'

	Please ensure you have a mouse and keyboard to use the solution (play the game).

HealthUp:

	This containes the entire Unity project, the scripts can be viewed without Unity, however if you want to view the entire project Unity must be installed.
	To navigate to the scripts I created for the solution, got to:

	HealthUp --> Assets --> Scripts

	For scripts in other assets and libraries:

	look in any of the other folders in Assets and find a Script(s) folder within them
